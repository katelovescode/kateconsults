> Kate's expertise as a technical lead during the development and implementation of MIRS 1.1, a pivotal project for our organization, was instrumental in achieving our objectives.
>
> Under Kate's leadership, we undertook the monumental task of completely replacing a 25-year-old legacy system, transitioning seamlessly from on-premises infrastructure to a 100% cloud-based solution. With over 4,000 users and processing more than 300,000 applicants annually, the scale of the project was immense.
>
> Kate led her team to build an intuitive UI that required minimal training, ensuring user adoption and efficiency. Kate's adeptness extended beyond internal systems, as she developed GraphQL APls connecting to 14 external systems and 8 internal applications. Many external partners relied solely on SFTP, requiring significant coaching and guidance in adopting API data exchange—a challenge Kate navigated with finesse.
>
> Despite the complexity of the project, Kate successfully led us to meet our go-live deadline with an MVP that fulfilled all critical business needs. Furthermore, she championed an agile culture within a client agency accustomed to waterfall methodologies.
>
> Navigating stringent Department of Defense security requirements, Kate ensured MIRS 1.1 complied with all regulations. Three years later, the system remains secure with uptime exceeding 99.9%, a testament to Kate's diligence and foresight.
>
> Moreover, Kate's contributions extended beyond the initial launch-her foundational work continues to support the development of new systems and features. Kate's dedication and expertise were indispensable, and it's fair to say that MIRS 1.1 would not have gone live without her. Kate's professionalism, expertise, and positive attitude made her a valuable asset to our team, and we're grateful for her contributions.

> I worked under Kate for a year and a half, and she was one of the best managers I’ve had. She was always very in-tune with the team’s desires, successes, and struggles, and worked hard to support her engineers in whatever way they need. For example, Kate once did a great job advocating for me in the aftermath of a production incident when I needed additional support in fielding questions and setting boundaries so I would be able to properly perform a root-cause analysis without interruption and distraction. She always advocated for the team and our product and UX partners, working hard to make sure everyone had a shared understanding and alignment on both our technical and product goals.
>
> She is very straightforward in communication and easy to talk to which was also a boon to the career coaching conversations I had with her. Together, we came up with concrete ways for me to move toward my personal goals, and she always advocated for engineers to use some of their time for professional development in addition to product work. She was always invested in understanding the situation around her, often asking questions to be sure she was on the same page, and she frequently requested feedback from her direct reports.
>
> All in all, Kate is a fantastic mentor and leader who cares deeply about her coworkers on a personal level. I always felt safe in any conversation I had with her, and I always found she was comfortable taking feedback, and I was comfortable providing it to her. She cares about finding processes that work for her team and allow developers to do good work while also taking care of themselves. She would be a great asset to any team.

> **-- Rebecca Holman, Software Engineer II, Toast**

> I've worked with Kate at two separate companies, a product engineering organization and a consulting agency, and I can confidently recommend working with her on projects of any size. During our time working together, Kate has leveraged her extensive professional network, internally and externally, to solve complex problems efficiently.
>
> At both companies, Kate provided effective leadership, formally and informally, guiding projects and mentoring team members. Kate has maintained a strong focus on taking decisive actions, and has exhibited courage by confidently voicing her opinions and ideas. One reason it's great to work with her is that she consistently seeks out feedback to improve processes and outcomes, demonstrating humility by acknowledging and learning from mistakes with grace.
>
> Kate is an excellent leader and any organization would be lucky to work with her.
