<h3>Culture</h3>
  <p>It's been widely studied and broadly shared; culture is 10x more impactful on whether or not employees stay at a company than compensation. <cite>(Source: <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/">MIT/Sloan</a>)</cite> Think about it, have <b>you</b> ever thought to yourself, <b>"You couldn't <i>pay me enough</i> to stay here..."</b> about somewhere you've worked?</p>
  
  <p>In my decade within the tech industry, it's become clear to me that the heart of any organization lies with its individual contributors. They are the backbone, tirelessly coding to deliver features, designing experiences to delight users, supporting customers when they're struggling, and driving sales to help your business thrive. Despite their pivotal role, however, <b>you keep losing these valuable contributors to turnover</b>. Why do employee satisfaction metrics reveal dissatisfaction or, worse yet, artificially inflated results? Why does your workforce greet 'Best Workplace' surveys with skepticism? It almost always boils down to the culture that's being established by leadershipâ€”or the lack thereof.</p>

  <p>You may have managers who oversee meetings, compile reports, and conduct performance evaluations, but <b>true leadership</b> transcends these tasks. It's about inspiring and empowering your teams, <b><i>because they are the experts</i></b>. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard and valued, where innovation flourishes, and where employees are genuinely motivated to excel. It's about leadership putting aside ego and fear in order to allow their subject-matter experts to bloom.</p>
  <p>I specialize in cultivating genuine leadership within your organization. I can help you build a cadre of managers who not only manage but <b>lead</b>, and grow your executives to be servant-leaders who understand that the true brilliance lies with those on the front lines. Together, we can create a culture where employees are empowered to thrive, driving both individual satisfaction and organizational success. Let's build a future where your company stands out as a beacon of empowered leadership and fulfilled employees.</p>
