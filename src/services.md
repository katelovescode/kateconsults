  <h2>Culture</h2>
  <p>
    It's been widely studied and broadly shared; culture is 10x more impactful
    on whether or not employees stay at a company than compensation.

    Have <b>you</b> ever thought to yourself,
    <b>"You couldn't <i>pay me enough</i> to stay here..."</b> about somewhere
    you've worked?
  </p>

  <p>
    Have you realized yet that compensation is a <b>part</b> of your culture?
  </p>

  <p>
    In my decade within the tech industry, it's become clear to me that the
    heart of any organization lies with its individual contributors. They are
    the backbone of the company, tirelessly coding to deliver features,
    designing experiences to delight users, supporting customers when they're
    struggling, and driving sales to help your business thrive. Despite their
    pivotal role, however,
    <b>you keep losing these valuable contributors to turnover</b>. Why do
    employee satisfaction metrics reveal dissatisfaction or, worse yet,
    artificially inflated results? Why does your workforce greet 'Best
    Workplace' surveys with skepticism? It almost always boils down to the
    culture that's being established by leadership—or the lack thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may have managers and directors who oversee meetings, compile reports,
    advise on roadmaps and budgets, and conduct performance evaluations, but do
    you have <b>leaders</b>? Leadership is about inspiring and empowering your
    teams, <b><i>because they are the experts</i></b
    >. It's about fostering an environment where every voice is heard and
    valued, where innovation flourishes, and where employees are genuinely
    motivated to excel. It's about leadership putting aside ego and fear in
    order to allow their subject-matter experts to bloom.
  </p>
  <p>
    A company's long-term success is rooted in cultivating an engineering
    culture that is empathetic, collaborative, and blameless. My unique
    background in theatre has allowed me to think outside the box and draw a
    unique comparison: whether you're building an engineering team or directing
    actors, the goal is the same - build an environment in which the individual
    contributes will do their <b>absolute best work</b>. Putting together a
    great cast, or a great engineering team, isn't about telling people exactly
    what to do or how to do it, it's about building autonomy, risk-resilience,
    and a culture of trust and respect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditional corporate culture often stands in stark contrast to this ideal.
    Many organizations operate under a top-down, directive approach that stifles
    creativity and discourages collaboration. To achieve long-term success and
    build a strong engineering department, this culture needs to shift. This
    involves moving away from blame and toward accountability; away from
    mandated process and toward heterogeneous, autonomous teams; away from
    meeting expectations and toward defying expectations to achieve even greater
    success. This requires empathy, understanding, and the ability to create a
    collaborative atmosphere where everyone's contributions are recognized and
    appreciated.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialize in cultivating genuine leadership within your organization. I
    can help you build a cadre of managers who not only manage but <b>lead</b>,
    and grow your executives to be servant-leaders who understand that the true
    brilliance lies with those on the front lines. If you share this vision and
    are interested in learning more about how we can work together to create a
    thriving engineering culture in your organization, I invite you to reach out
    to me. Together, we can create a culture where employees are empowered to
    thrive, driving both individual satisfaction and organizational success.
    Let's build a future where your company stands out as a beacon of empowered
    leadership and fulfilled employees.
